# Research Roadmap

## Status

`R0_5_R1_R2_DESIGN_BASELINED / R3_PRAGMATICS_DESIGN_SPECIFIED / IMPLEMENTATION_NOT_STARTED / NOT_IMPLEMENTATION_READY`

The roadmap is intentionally gated. Later phases do not inherit qualification merely because earlier phases succeeded.

## R0 — Research corpus and assumptions ledger

### Objective

Establish the conceptual and evidentiary baseline.

### Deliverables

- project thesis;
- research landscape;
- references;
- claims/evidence ledger;
- explicit assumptions;
- failure-mode inventory;
- competing architecture list.

### Gate

`R0_RESEARCH_BASELINED`

Current status: `DESIGN_BASELINED`.

Pass meaning: a reviewer can distinguish established prior work, current project hypothesis, speculation, and untested assumption.

## R0.5 — Information, experiment-integrity, and claim-provenance audit

### Objective

Before comparing semantic substrates, verify that the target distinction is actually available to the participating system, that preprocessing has not destroyed it, that infrastructure has not secretly supplied it, and that the hypothesis family itself has valid provenance.

See [`R0_5_INFORMATION_INTEGRITY_AUDIT.md`](R0_5_INFORMATION_INTEGRITY_AUDIT.md).

### Required capabilities

- claim-relative empirical identifiability;
- learner-visible witness provenance;
- upstream generative provenance from world/generator through learner exposure;
- bridge/adapter attribution;
- instrumentation and simulator-latent leakage controls;
- claim-relative no-destructive-quotient preprocessing audit;
- hypothesis-family provenance and freeze timing;
- open/null rival escape;
- structured-rival adequacy status;
- explicit boundary model using experiment-level exposure/control loci rather than mandatory natural-agent assumptions;
- claim ceilings for underdetermined or unverifiable conditions.

### Required controls

- `CTRL_BRIDGE_ORACLE`;
- `CTRL_RAW_SCENE_ORACLE`;
- `CTRL_GLOBAL_STATE_WATERMARK`;
- `CTRL_DESTRUCTIVE_QUOTIENT`;
- `CTRL_POSTHOC_SEMANTIC_NAMING`;
- `CTRL_IID_HOLDOUT_ILLUSION`.

### Gate sequence

`R0_5_AUDIT_SPECIFIED` — design complete.

`R0_5_AUDIT_QUALIFIED` — future status requiring the harness to correctly classify the required positive/negative fixtures and expose unresolved generative/preprocessing provenance instead of assuming neutrality.

Current status: `R0_5_AUDIT_SPECIFIED / NOT_IMPLEMENTED`.

R0.5 is not a semantic qualification. It is the integrity/identifiability gate that determines whether later semantic claims are even admissible.

## R1 — Minimal semantic substrate competition

### Objective

Define and compare the smallest formal representations capable of supporting the first experiments without silently privileging one human-readable ontology.

### Frozen R1 design rivals

1. **TPH — Typed Probabilistic Hypergraph**: explicit structured relational hypotheses.
2. **DCA — Denotational Constraint Algebra**: executable constraints/operators over compatible situations and trajectories.
3. **PIS — Predictive-Intervention State**: action-conditioned predictions and signal-induced predictive changes.

See [`R1_SUBSTRATE_COMPETITION.md`](R1_SUBSTRATE_COMPETITION.md).

### Required comparison properties

- same control tasks;
- same evaluator;
- no hidden English ontology;
- uncertainty/provenance support;
- semantic-conservation support;
- intervention/prediction support;
- cross-task and partner transfer;
- complexity accounting including adapter complexity;
- multiple seeds and independently generated worlds;
- R0.5-qualified interaction surfaces and provenance paths.

### Gate sequence

`R1_COMPETITION_SPECIFIED` — design complete, common contract and rivals frozen.

`R1_SUBSTRATE_EMPIRICALLY_QUALIFIED` — future status requiring R0.5/R2-qualified runs.

`R1_SUBSTRATE_SELECTED` — optional later status; a single winner is not required. Pareto-nondominated rivals may continue.

Current status: `R1_COMPETITION_SPECIFIED / NOT_IMPLEMENTED`.

No substrate becomes architecture canon unless it earns complexity over a simpler rival.

## R2 — Trustworthy adversarial experiment harness

### Objective

Build the evaluator before claiming semantic learning and make it capable of rejecting high-performing shortcut systems, hidden semantic subsidy, and overstrong semantic interpretation.

### Design artifacts

- [`R2_ADVERSARIAL_EVALUATOR.md`](R2_ADVERSARIAL_EVALUATOR.md);
- [`R2_NEGATIVE_CONTROLS.md`](R2_NEGATIVE_CONTROLS.md);
- [`R2_SEMANTIC_CLAIM_CONTROLS.md`](R2_SEMANTIC_CLAIM_CONTROLS.md);
- [`../specs/R1R2_EVALUATION_CONTRACT_V1.yaml`](../specs/R1R2_EVALUATION_CONTRACT_V1.yaml);
- [`../research/R1R2_RESEARCH_NOTES.md`](../research/R1R2_RESEARCH_NOTES.md).

### Required capabilities

- deterministic world generation/replay;
- evaluator-only hidden truth zone;
- independently randomized sensor renderers;
- learner/evaluator separation;
- configuration and seed binding;
- independent metric recomputation;
- sensory asymmetry;
- pluggable and unknown channels;
- no-communication controls;
- label/latent leak controls;
- private-code controls;
- causal message interventions;
- world-factor interventions;
- role reversal;
- cross-task transfer;
- partner swap/third-party acquisition;
- ontology-mismatch/non-equivalence tests;
- interaction logs;
- conservation/provenance evaluation;
- automated shortcut search;
- confirmatory versus exploratory semantic-interpretation tracking;
- claim-discriminating holdouts/interventions rather than freshness alone;
- structured-rival adequacy status;
- explicit `SEMANTIC_SURPLUS_OBLIGATION` for claims stronger than a verified operational relation.

### Core methodological rule

Task success is not a semantic certificate. An arbitrary signal convention is not a failure merely because its symbols are opaque. The evaluator targets hidden common ground and task-bound shortcuts: episode IDs, shared latent state, action-plan codes, memorization, reward side channels, co-training artifacts, and other explanations that fail grounded transfer.

A robust operational relation is a legitimate result but does not automatically justify a semantic name. Stronger semantic labels must add an explicit falsifiable burden beyond ordinary predictive/coordination success.

### Harness gate

`HARNESS_TRUSTWORTHY`

The harness must reject all preregistered negative controls on the dimensions they violate and pass positive oracles before any R1 candidate hidden evaluation.

Thresholds are calibrated using only chance/null controls, positive oracles, negative controls, and harness-only pilot worlds, then frozen before candidate hidden results are inspected.

No post-hoc semantic interpretation may be promoted using the same evidence that selected it. A later confirmation must use claim-discriminating fresh evidence that materially separates the proposed interpretation from strongest live structured alternatives.

Current status: `R2_EVALUATOR_SPECIFIED / R2_SEMANTIC_CLAIM_CONTROLS_SPECIFIED / HARNESS_NOT_BUILT`.

## R3 — Human/synthetic semantic and pragmatic controls

### Objective

Prove that the protocol can recover known semantic relationships without direct dictionaries and preserve interactional distinctions when denotation alone is insufficient.

R3 contains two complementary qualification profiles rather than replacing the existing control phase:

1. human-language and synthetic-language semantic controls;
2. adversarial pragmatics and interaction controls.

R3 is downstream of both R0.5 and R2. It cannot repair a target distinction that R0.5 found unidentifiable, preprocessing-destroyed, evaluator-subsidized, or post-hoc without claim-discriminating confirmation, and it cannot compensate for R2 grounding failure.

### Semantic-control work

- multiple unrelated natural-language controls;
- at least one signed/spatial control;
- synthetic compositional language;
- synthetic context-dependent language;
- synthetic non-equivalent categories.

### Pragmatics/interaction work

- same denotation with different communicative functions;
- same form under causally different versus nuisance contexts;
- deictic/perspective role shifts;
- indirect-function and background-dependency tests;
- addressee versus overhearer distinctions;
- audience-dependent behavior;
- targeted repair versus reflex repair;
- convention establishment, drift, repair, and false common ground;
- strategic ambiguity and deceptive use of an intact convention;
- partner transfer and role reversal where applicable;
- multimodal channel conflict;
- function preservation across different forms and ontologies;
- explicit pragmatic conservation accounting.

- [`../research/PRAGMATICS_REFERENCES.md`](../research/PRAGMATICS_REFERENCES.md).

### Gate

Semantic-control qualification requires recovery of known mappings, uncertainty preservation, and correct identification of at least some non-equivalences under the frozen R0.5/R2 evaluator stack.

Pragmatic qualification may additionally emit `PRAGMATICALLY_GROUNDED_WITHIN_TESTED_SCOPE` only after:

- the R0.5 claim ceiling permits the tested semantic/pragmatic claim;
- the underlying R2 grounding/semantic-claim requirements are satisfied;
- applicable P01–P20 tests pass;
- required R3 negative controls and positive oracles behave as preregistered;
- pragmatic conservation survives audit.

R3 PASS does not establish human-like intention, consciousness, theory of mind, or universal pragmatics.

Current status: `R3_PRAGMATICS_EVALUATOR_SPECIFIED / HARNESS_NOT_BUILT / NO_PRAGMATIC_QUALIFICATION`.

## R4 — Zero-shared-vocabulary grounded communication

### Objective

Agents invent communication from scratch in a shared world or other declared interaction surface.

### Work

- referential grounding where justified;
- relation grounding;
- role reversal;
- compositional recombination;
- transfer to a new task.

### Adversaries

- private-code agent;
- memorizer;
- shared-latent shortcut;
- action-plan code;
- episode-ID code;
- hidden bridge/adapter subsidy;
- simulator-state instrumentation leak.

### Gate

Task success must survive R0.5 integrity controls plus R2 semantic probes, causal interventions, and cross-task/partner transfer.

## R5 — Unknown and nonlinguistic communication channels

### Objective

Remove message segmentation and linguistic assumptions.

### Work

- continuous signals;
- timing;
- motion;
- orientation;
- environmental modification;
- multimodal channels;
- overlapping/concurrent structure;
- no-communication worlds.

### Gate

The system must discover useful regularities/signalhood with controlled false positives and ground at least some continuous/nonlinguistic mappings without relying on lossy forced serialization that destroys the tested distinction.

## R6 — Context, asymmetry, and ontology mismatch

### Objective

Attack the assumption that both parties experience or categorize the world the same way.

### Work

- context-dependent signals;
- asymmetric sensors;
- different coordinate frames;
- different object segmentation;
- unavailable sensory dimensions;
- many-to-one/one-to-many mappings;
- semantic drift;
- experimenter-boundary sensitivity.

### Gate

The system must preserve partial mappings and return scoped non-equivalence/unknown results when appropriate rather than forcing evaluator-authored categories.

## R7 — Active semantic science

### Objective

Move from passive association to discriminating experiment design.

### Work

- competing semantic hypotheses;
- information-gain baseline;
- safe intervention policy;
- causal vs predictive distinction;
- counterfactual tests;
- repair and clarification;
- structured alternative generation and model criticism.

### Gate

Active testing must improve hypothesis discrimination over passive baselines without self-confirming bias. Hypotheses may choose tests but may not count as evidence for themselves.

## R8 — Meta-communication and self-description

### Objective

Teach communication about communication itself.

### Work

- repeat/repair;
- uncertainty;
- questions/probes;
- convention revision;
- explaining mappings;
- self-demonstrating and recursively self-describing protocol fragments.

### Gate

A receiver not pretrained on the protocol must recover enough of the protocol to participate in further bootstrap.

## R9 — Cross-architecture receiver qualification

### Objective

Eliminate success tied to one learner implementation.

### Work

- independently implemented sender/receiver systems;
- different model families;
- from-scratch agents;
- pretrained agents with contamination controls;
- cross-partner convention transfer.

### Gate

At least two materially different receiver architectures independently reconstruct equivalent tested invariants from the same bootstrap curriculum without shared hidden bridges.

## R10 — Interstellar broadcast simulation

### Objective

Simulate an uncoordinated receiver receiving a self-describing signal over an impaired channel.

### Work

- signal detection;
- framing inference;
- redundancy/error corruption;
- number/ratio/physics curriculum;
- semantic substrate teaching;
- reply protocol reconstruction.

### Gate

Receiver must recover useful structure without access to human language, source code, hidden metadata, shared framing configuration, or evaluator-only instrumentation.

## R11 — Embodied probe simulation

### Objective

Evaluate the interactive translator-probe concept.

### Work

- unknown process/agent detection;
- safe signalhood experiments;
- grounded semantic negotiation;
- action/permission separation;
- long-lived convention memory;
- counterpart change/drift;
- multiple agents/groups/distributed loci.

### Gate

The probe must demonstrate useful semantic bridge construction while staying inside strict action-authority bounds.

## R12 — Human and animal-research interfaces

### Objective

Evaluate whether the architecture transfers beyond synthetic agents.

### Candidate work

- human zero-shared-language experiments;
- collaboration with linguists/sign-language researchers;
- animal-communication datasets with behavioral context;
- Project CETI-like multimodal data interfaces;
- archival Earth communication systems.

### Boundary

Do not claim animal translation from acoustic prediction alone.

A stable informational cue is not automatically communicative use; communicative function and intentionality require separate evidence.

Human/animal work requires appropriate ethical and domain expertise.

## R13 — Interstellar package candidate

### Objective

Only after prior gates: define a bounded candidate package for a broadcast, probe, or hybrid system.

### Required artifacts

- physical-layer assumptions;
- self-description curriculum;
- semantic protocol;
- human knowledge corpus;
- conservation/provenance rules;
- receiver tests;
- failure behavior;
- governance boundaries;
- versioning and longevity strategy.

### Gate

`INTERSTELLAR_PACKAGE_RESEARCH_CANDIDATE`

This status does not authorize transmission or deployment.

## Parallel workstreams

Some research can proceed in parallel:

- literature review;
- synthetic-world generator design;
- synthetic-language generator design;
- nonlinguistic channel taxonomy;
- semantic conservation metrics;
- pragmatics/common-ground/interaction research;
- physical-layer/bootstrap research;
- experiment-integrity and instrumentation-leak research;
- safety/governance research.

Experimental claims remain ordered by qualification gates.

## Near-term next steps after R0.5/R1/R2/R3 design

1. Revise the machine-readable R1/R2 evaluation contract to include R0.5 audit fields, stable semantic control IDs, generative/instrumentation provenance, claim-discriminating holdout status, structured-rival adequacy, and semantic-surplus obligations.
2. Implement the deterministic world/evaluator skeleton before implementing a sophisticated learner.
3. Implement the R2 positive controls and existing N00-N24 negative controls plus the semantic/integrity controls (`CTRL_BRIDGE_ORACLE`, `CTRL_RAW_SCENE_ORACLE`, `CTRL_GLOBAL_STATE_WATERMARK`, `CTRL_DESTRUCTIVE_QUOTIENT`, `CTRL_POSTHOC_SEMANTIC_NAMING`, `CTRL_IID_HOLDOUT_ILLUSION`).
4. Freeze the R0.5/R2 control acceptance matrix and verify `R0_5_AUDIT_QUALIFIED` and `HARNESS_TRUSTWORTHY` on intentionally broken systems.
5. Convert a bounded subset of the first 100 challenge families into machine-readable scenario specifications.
6. Implement the common substrate adapter contract.
7. Implement the smallest credible TPH, DCA, and PIS candidates under matched budgets.
8. Calibrate and freeze the first candidate-independent R2 qualification profile.
9. Run R1 candidates only after the hidden holdout generation rule, hypothesis-family provenance rules, and instrumentation boundary are frozen.
10. Implement an R3 synthetic pragmatic world family supporting at least P01, P02, P03, P07, P11, P14, and P20 without human speech-act labels.
11. Implement R3 `RP00`–`RP03` and `RN00`–`RN09`, then verify the R3 harness classifies them as specified before candidate pragmatic qualification.
12. Build one synthetic language with deliberately non-English semantics for R3 semantic controls.
13. Build one continuous/nonlinguistic channel for R5-compatible early stress testing, including at least one condition where forced serialization destroys a target-relevant distinction.
14. Preserve every run with code/config/world/evaluator/instrumentation digests, boundary model, rival-family version, pragmatic-profile version, and immutable metric traces.
15. Treat discovery of any new shortcut, semantic-subsidy path, pragmatic shortcut, or claim-control failure as an evaluator-version event requiring a new control and requalification.
