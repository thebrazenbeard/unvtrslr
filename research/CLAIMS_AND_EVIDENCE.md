# Claims and Evidence Ledger

This file separates prior evidence from UNVTRSLR hypotheses and speculation.

Status vocabulary:

- `SUPPORTED_PRIOR_WORK` — directly supported by cited research.
- `SUPPORTED_LIMITED_SCOPE` — supported only under narrower conditions than the project target.
- `PROJECT_HYPOTHESIS` — plausible but not demonstrated for UNVTRSLR.
- `DESIGN_REQUIREMENT` — chosen constraint, not empirical fact.
- `OPEN_QUESTION` — unresolved.
- `SPECULATIVE_INTERSTELLAR` — extrapolation beyond validated Earth evidence.

## C001 — Formal symbols do not automatically provide grounded meaning

**Status:** `SUPPORTED_PRIOR_WORK`

Harnad's symbol-grounding problem directly motivates this claim.

**Project consequence:** mathematics may carry formal structure but cannot simply be declared universally meaningful.

## C002 — Shared environmental interaction can bootstrap communication conventions

**Status:** `SUPPORTED_LIMITED_SCOPE`

Grounded language-game and robot experiments show shared lexicons and simple compositional structures emerging under situated interaction.

**Limit:** those systems generally assume more shared perceptual/task structure than the strongest UNVTRSLR target.

## C003 — Successful emergent communication can lack evaluator-recognizable conceptual semantics

**Status:** `SUPPORTED_PRIOR_WORK`

Bouchacourt & Baroni (2018) show successful communication despite visual representations that do not capture the conceptual properties humans assume the symbols denote.

**Project consequence:** task reward alone cannot qualify semantic grounding.

## C004 — Richer/generalization-oriented games can improve emergent communication structure

**Status:** `SUPPORTED_LIMITED_SCOPE`

Mu & Goodman and related work support this under controlled artificial-agent tasks.

**Project consequence:** first experiments should require generalizations and relationships, not only single-object reference.

## C005 — Compositionality and generalization are not identical

**Status:** `SUPPORTED_PRIOR_WORK`

Emergent-language research finds they can dissociate depending on task and metric.

**Project consequence:** use multiple compositionality/generalization measures and behavioral tests.

## C006 — Humans can create new nonlinguistic conventions using common ground

**Status:** `SUPPORTED_PRIOR_WORK`

Human experiments on instantaneous conventions show minimal signals can acquire context-dependent communicative functions.

**Project consequence:** nonlinguistic bootstrap is empirically plausible at least for humans.

## C007 — A cross-linguistic human semantic core may exist

**Status:** `SUPPORTED_LIMITED_SCOPE`

NSM researchers propose 65 semantic primes shared across human languages and provide extensive cross-linguistic evidence.

**Limit:** the claim remains a linguistic theory about humans; it is not evidence of species-independent universality.

## C008 — Cross-lingual formal meaning representations are feasible

**Status:** `SUPPORTED_LIMITED_SCOPE`

UMR demonstrates a graph formalism representing shared semantic structures across multiple diverse human languages.

**Limit:** UMR categories remain human-linguistic and do not prove modality- or species-neutrality.

## C009 — Nonhuman communication can encode quantitative/spatial structure in non-word-like behavior

**Status:** `SUPPORTED_PRIOR_WORK`

Honeybee waggle dances encode direction and distance through motion parameters.

**Project consequence:** discrete symbols cannot be an ingress requirement.

## C010 — Animal signals can require context for interpretation

**Status:** `SUPPORTED_PRIOR_WORK`

Later vervet-monkey work shows context dependence and overlap beyond simple predator-word mappings.

**Project consequence:** use conditional semantic hypotheses rather than fixed dictionaries.

## C011 — Predictive acoustic modeling is not equivalent to demonstrated semantic translation

**Status:** `DESIGN_REQUIREMENT`

This is a methodological distinction supported by the gap between acoustic-generation objectives and behavioral semantic evidence.

**Project consequence:** animal-inspired controls must separate acoustic structure from meaning claims.

## C012 — Progressive mathematical/scientific teaching has historical precedent in interstellar messaging

**Status:** `SUPPORTED_PRIOR_WORK`

Lincos is the strongest direct example; Voyager/Arecibo and later message designs also use mathematics/physics as bootstrap material.

## C013 — Lincos assumes a mentally humanlike receiver

**Status:** `SUPPORTED_PRIOR_WORK`

Freudenthal states this assumption explicitly.

**Project consequence:** UNVTRSLR should test synthetic receivers that violate it.

## C014 — Shared physics may offer interstellar common ground

**Status:** `PROJECT_HYPOTHESIS`

Interstellar-message literature commonly treats physics and mathematics as promising shared structure, but exosemiotic critiques warn that representations and concepts need not be interpreted identically.

**Project consequence:** use physics as a candidate anchor to be demonstrated, not an assumed language.

## C015 — A translator may be a better interstellar payload than a static message

**Status:** `SPECULATIVE_INTERSTELLAR`

This is the founding UNVTRSLR proposition.

**Supporting reasoning:** an adaptive system can test mappings after contact rather than requiring all semantics to be anticipated before launch.

**Major limitation:** embodied probes have extreme travel-time and autonomy constraints; broadcasts lack local shared interaction.

## C016 — Signalhood can be inferred without a pre-labeled communication channel

**Status:** `PROJECT_HYPOTHESIS`

Human and animal research suggests audience effects, contingency, coordination, and interaction patterns can reveal communicative function.

**Not yet shown:** a general artificial system that can reliably discover signalhood under the full UNVTRSLR conditions.

## C017 — Shared semantics can emerge despite different sensory encodings

**Status:** `PROJECT_HYPOTHESIS`

Grounded and multimodal research makes this plausible, but the strongest condition—materially different perceptual ontologies with no shared latent representation—requires direct testing.

## C018 — Active interventions can distinguish semantic hypotheses better than passive association

**Status:** `PROJECT_HYPOTHESIS`

The principle follows standard experimental-design reasoning, but its benefit and safety tradeoffs in semantic bootstrap must be measured.

## C019 — Semantic non-equivalence can be detected operationally

**Status:** `PROJECT_HYPOTHESIS`

Human translation already contains many partial/one-to-many mappings, but a system that discovers rather than receives non-equivalence requires experimental validation.

## C020 — A universal representation grammar may be possible without a universal ontology

**Status:** `PROJECT_HYPOTHESIS`

Candidate structural responsibilities include event, relation, quantity, time, space, provenance, uncertainty, and alternatives.

**Falsifier:** if successful systems require domain-specific or species-specific primitives so extensively that the common kernel contributes no transferable value.

## C021 — Semantic conservation can be evaluated independently of target-text similarity

**Status:** `PROJECT_HYPOTHESIS`

The proposed method uses tested invariants, interventions, and independent semantic reconstruction.

**Open:** how to discover important invariants without human annotation at scale.

## C022 — Role reversal is stronger evidence of shared semantics than one-way response success

**Status:** `DESIGN_REQUIREMENT`

This is adopted as a qualification pressure rather than claimed as a universal psychological law.

## C023 — Scoped no-faithful-equivalent outcomes should be rewarded

**Status:** `DESIGN_REQUIREMENT`

Without a non-equivalence outcome, evaluation incentivizes forced translation and anthropocentric category collapse.

For ordinary finite evaluation, the warranted form is scoped, such as:

`NO_FAITHFUL_EQUIVALENT_FOUND_WITHIN_TESTED_SCOPE`

The certificate should bind the source/target representation families, tested context family, evidence/intervention set, and relevant composition/search/compute budget where material.

An unqualified `NO_FAITHFUL_EQUIVALENT` should be reserved for a separately justified impossibility result, not an ordinary unsuccessful search.

## C024 — English should not be the internal semantic substrate

**Status:** `DESIGN_REQUIREMENT`

English is one renderer among many. Internal English would silently privilege English categories.

## C025 — A self-describing semantic broadcast is possible

**Status:** `OPEN_QUESTION / SPECULATIVE_INTERSTELLAR`

Lincos and interstellar-decoding literature suggest progressive teaching can convey increasingly rich structure, but a receiver with radically different priors may fail to reconstruct framing or intended semantics.

## C026 — A self-describing protocol can be tested on Earth

**Status:** `PROJECT_HYPOTHESIS`

Receivers can be denied protocol documentation and evaluated on how much framing/semantics they reconstruct from controlled streams.

## C027 — Probe and broadcast architectures should share a semantic core but different bootstrap regimes

**Status:** `DESIGN_REQUIREMENT`

Local interaction changes the problem enough that one curriculum should not be assumed optimal for both.

## C028 — Communication understanding must remain separate from permission to act

**Status:** `DESIGN_REQUIREMENT`

Especially important for embodied probe or machine-control settings.

## C029 — No current evidence proves a truly universal translator is feasible

**Status:** `SUPPORTED_PRIOR_WORK / PROJECT_BOUNDARY`

Existing work demonstrates partial responsibilities under constrained assumptions. The combined zero-language, unknown-channel, asymmetric-ontology target remains unproven.

## C030 — The project is scientifically useful even if universality fails

**Status:** `PROJECT_HYPOTHESIS`

A staged failure can identify which assumptions—shared perception, common context, cooperation, compositionality, interaction, or humanlike concepts—are actually necessary for communication.

## R1/R2 additions

## C031 — A semantic substrate need not be an explicit symbolic ontology

**Status:** `SUPPORTED_LIMITED_SCOPE / PROJECT_HYPOTHESIS`

Predictive-state-representation research shows that dynamical state can be represented using action-conditioned predictions of future observations rather than hidden-state labels.

**Project consequence:** PIS is a serious non-symbolic R1 rival.

**Limit:** prior PSR work does not establish semantic communication or translation.

## C032 — Message/action correlation does not establish communication

**Status:** `SUPPORTED_PRIOR_WORK`

Lowe et al. demonstrate settings where messages contain information about subsequent actions but do not causally affect the environment or other agent.

**Project consequence:** direct message intervention and ablation are critical R2 tests.

## C033 — Causal listening is necessary but not sufficient for grounded semantics

**Status:** `DESIGN_REQUIREMENT / PROJECT_HYPOTHESIS`

Counterfactual social-influence research supports causal influence as a stronger communication signal than correlation alone.

However, an action-plan code may causally control a receiver while remaining task-bound.

**Project consequence:** causal listening must be combined with world-factor interventions, cross-task transfer, role reversal, and partner transfer.

## C034 — Arbitrary notation is not evidence against grounding

**Status:** `DESIGN_REQUIREMENT`

A convention may use arbitrary signs while remaining externally grounded.

**Project consequence:** R2 ignores consequence-preserving symbol permutations. It targets hidden common ground and task-private shortcuts rather than human unreadability.

## C035 — Unique unsupervised semantic ontology recovery cannot be assumed

**Status:** `SUPPORTED_LIMITED_SCOPE / PROJECT_BOUNDARY`

Locatello et al. show that unsupervised disentangled representation learning is not identifiable without inductive biases.

**Project consequence:** UNVTRSLR must record substrate inductive biases and avoid claiming a unique true internal ontology from observation alone.

## C036 — Grounding qualification must be explicitly scope-bounded

**Status:** `DESIGN_REQUIREMENT`

No finite evaluator can distinguish hypotheses that make identical predictions over every tested observation and intervention but diverge only outside the tested family.

**Project consequence:** use scoped qualification, bind certificates to exact world/intervention families, and retain surviving alternative explanations.

## C037 — Cross-task and third-party transfer are key tests against private task code

**Status:** `PROJECT_HYPOTHESIS / DESIGN_REQUIREMENT`

If a signal tracks a reusable world invariant, it should often remain useful when the optimal downstream action changes and should be re-groundable by an independently initialized partner.

**Falsifier:** if genuinely grounded conventions systematically fail these tests while known private task codes pass them under a trustworthy harness.

## C038 — A richer semantic substrate should not win by interpretability alone

**Status:** `DESIGN_REQUIREMENT`

Human-readable graphs can create false confidence.

**Project consequence:** R1 uses empirical semantic qualification plus explicit complexity accounting. A richer substrate must earn complexity through transfer, calibration, non-equivalence, conservation, or efficiency.

## C039 — No single scalar should certify grounded meaning

**Status:** `DESIGN_REQUIREMENT`

Task reward, mutual information, compositionality, causal influence, reconstruction accuracy, and language similarity each capture only part of the target.

**Project consequence:** R2 emits a conjunctive operational-grounding vector with critical failure gates.

## C040 — A semantic evaluator must be able to reject strong intentionally broken systems

**Status:** `DESIGN_REQUIREMENT`

An evaluator that only recognizes obvious random failure has not demonstrated shortcut resistance.

**Project consequence:** R2 requires a suite of adversarial negative controls designed to perform well on naive task metrics.

## R0.5 / semantic-claim-control additions

## C041 — Empirical identifiability is claim-relative

**Status:** `DESIGN_REQUIREMENT / PROJECT_HYPOTHESIS`

Whether a distinction is recoverable depends on the declared interaction surface, admissible strategy family, budget, statistical resolution, and rival hypotheses.

If two rival mappings induce indistinguishable learner-accessible histories under every admissible strategy within the tested scope, the experiment cannot support unique identification between them within that scope.

**Project consequence:** R0.5 must permit `UNIDENTIFIABLE_WITHIN_INTERACTION_SURFACE` rather than forcing a semantic choice.

## C042 — Useful learner-visible information can be supplied by experiment infrastructure rather than learned by the participants

**Status:** `DESIGN_REQUIREMENT`

A privileged bridge, raw-scene writer, renderer, or instrumentation channel can create genuinely predictive learner-visible evidence while doing part of the cross-system semantic work itself.

**Project consequence:** empirical distinguishability and learner/participant attribution are separate audit dimensions.

## C043 — Preprocessing and generative instrumentation can both invalidate a grounding claim

**Status:** `DESIGN_REQUIREMENT`

Preprocessing can destroy a target-relevant distinction, while instrumentation can add privileged target-specific or target-independent latent-state information.

**Project consequence:** R0.5 requires claim-relative preservation checks plus full generative/witness provenance. Unknown material provenance narrows the claim ceiling rather than being presumed neutral.

## C044 — Hypothesis-family provenance is required for confirmatory semantic claims

**Status:** `DESIGN_REQUIREMENT`

A real learned operational partition can be given a human semantic label only after the evaluator inspects it. Excellent same-data fit does not independently confirm that post-hoc label.

**Project consequence:** distinguish preregistered/confirmatory claims from exploratory post-hoc interpretations and record when the target/rival family was frozen.

## C045 — Fresh IID evidence is not automatically claim-discriminating evidence

**Status:** `DESIGN_REQUIREMENT / PROJECT_HYPOTHESIS`

A new sample from the same confounded environment can preserve the same nuisance/semantic correlation indefinitely.

**Project consequence:** stronger semantic confirmation should use interventions, domain shifts, or other evidence designed to separate the proposed interpretation from strong live alternatives where the claim depends on that distinction.

## C046 — A null/open rival does not establish rival-family adequacy

**Status:** `DESIGN_REQUIREMENT`

`NONE_OF_DECLARED_RIVALS` prevents forced choice among named options, but an omitted structured explanation may still fit as well or better than the selected semantic label.

**Project consequence:** record rejection-escape presence separately from structured-alternative stress and family adequacy.

## C047 — Operational relation verification and semantic naming are non-monotonic, separable claims

**Status:** `DESIGN_REQUIREMENT`

A reusable, transferable, causally useful operational relation may survive while a proposed semantic interpretation remains unresolved, confounded, or unsupported.

**Project consequence:** certificates must preserve the lower operational success when a stronger semantic claim fails, rather than representing qualification as a single automatic ladder.

## C048 — A stronger semantic claim must incur an independently falsifiable burden

**Status:** `DESIGN_REQUIREMENT / PROJECT_HYPOTHESIS`

Calling a relation `semantic` should add testable content beyond saying that it is a reusable predictive or coordination relation.

A candidate semantic claim should identify a condition under which the lower operational relation may remain true while the stronger semantic claim becomes false.

**Boundary:** arbitrary extra difficulty does not count. The added test must be motivated by content asserted by the stronger claim, not merely by evaluator preference.

**Falsifier:** if no independently motivated observable consequence distinguishes the stronger semantic claim from the lower operational claim, the semantic label should not be promoted within that scope.

## C049 — Exposure/control boundaries are experimental provenance, not a universal ontology of agents

**Status:** `DESIGN_REQUIREMENT`

The experiment may need operational boundaries around loci that receive state or influence the coupled system, but those loci need not correspond to exactly two natural agents.

**Project consequence:** record `BOUNDARY_MODEL` and bind any claim that depends materially on a particular individuation.

## C050 — Hidden machinery honesty cannot always be inferred from learner traces alone

**Status:** `PROJECT_BOUNDARY / DESIGN_REQUIREMENT`

If inaccessible simulator or instrumentation machinery secretly exports privileged latent state into learner evidence, downstream behavioral traces may be insufficient to prove that subsidy absent.

**Project consequence:** bind generator/renderer/instrumentation artifacts where possible and fail closed with a narrower claim when material generative provenance cannot be established.

## R3 pragmatics and interaction additions

## C051 — Human communicated meaning can exceed conventional sentence meaning

**Status:** `SUPPORTED_LIMITED_SCOPE`

Gricean and relevance-theoretic pragmatics provide extensive human-language evidence that what a speaker communicates can depend on context and inference beyond conventional sentence-level content.

**Limit:** this does not establish a universal intention-recognition architecture or human pragmatic categories for arbitrary agents.

**Project consequence:** R3 may test indirect/function-level interpretation while requiring explicit inference provenance and calibrated alternatives.

## C052 — Human conventions can be partner-specific and history-dependent

**Status:** `SUPPORTED_PRIOR_WORK`

Experimental work on conceptual pacts shows that human interlocutors develop partner-specific conceptualizations and lexical entrainment that persist beyond immediate informativeness.

**Project consequence:** convention records should bind participants and interaction history; partner-specific success must not be silently promoted to a general mapping.

## C053 — Repair behavior is evidence of interaction structure, not proof of understanding

**Status:** `SUPPORTED_LIMITED_SCOPE / DESIGN_REQUIREMENT`

Conversation-analysis and cross-linguistic repair research show organized human repair practices, but a reflex policy can imitate repetition or correction after failure without representing what was misunderstood.

**Project consequence:** R3 tests targeted repair against `RN04_repair_reflex` and scores novel trouble-source discrimination rather than repair-like surface behavior alone.

## C054 — Task success and even causal influence are insufficient for pragmatic equivalence

**Status:** `SUPPORTED_PRIOR_WORK / DESIGN_REQUIREMENT`

Emergent-communication research shows that high reward, message/action correlation, and in some cases causal use can coexist with task-bound protocols that do not preserve reusable semantic or pragmatic distinctions.

**Project consequence:** pragmatic qualification requires function discrimination, changed-task transfer, partner transfer where applicable, conservation audits, and shortcut controls.

## C055 — Functional similarity must not erase meaning-bearing form

**Status:** `SUPPORTED_PRIOR_WORK / DESIGN_REQUIREMENT`

Research on iconicity, systematicity, gesture, timing, and multimodality shows that form can itself carry information. The predecessor slogan “translate functions, not words” is therefore too strong if interpreted as function automatically outranking form.

**Project consequence:** translation should preserve the tested invariants that matter in scope, including formal/iconic structure when demonstrated. `FUNCTIONALLY_EQUIVALENT` remains typed and scoped rather than synonymous with `same meaning`.

## C056 — Operational common ground should remain separate from claims about another agent's internal state

**Status:** `DESIGN_REQUIREMENT / SUPPORTED_LIMITED_SCOPE`

Human common-ground and grounding theories motivate tracking evidence of jointly usable conventions, while convention theory does not require UNVTRSLR to prove infinitely nested symmetric beliefs.

**Project consequence:** separate `interactionally_supported_common_ground`, `counterpart_epistemic_hypothesis`, and evaluator-only mutual-state truth.

## C057 — Human pragmatic categories are useful adversarial families, not species-neutral primitives

**Status:** `SUPPORTED_LIMITED_SCOPE / PROJECT_BOUNDARY`

Human-language research supports rich distinctions such as deixis, repair, presupposition, implicature, addressee effects, and request/assertion-like functions. Cross-linguistic diversity cautions against promoting those manifestations into a universal ontology.

**Project consequence:** R3 uses human categories as control families while requiring a nonhuman positive oracle that can pass without human sentence or speech-act structure.

## C058 — Absence or withholding is meaningful only when an expectation relation is evidenced

**Status:** `DESIGN_REQUIREMENT / PROJECT_HYPOTHESIS`

Human and animal signaling literature motivates treating omission or withholding as potentially communicative, but missing behavior is also explained by noise, latency, sensor failure, inactivity, or physical inability.

**Project consequence:** R3 `P06` requires counterfactual evidence distinguishing strategic withholding from matched random loss before absence receives semantic credit.

## Open research gaps to investigate next

1. Formal literature on signalhood/intention detection without labeled communication channels.
2. Active-learning methods optimized for semantic hypothesis discrimination.
3. Semiotic models that do not assume discrete symbols.
4. Cross-modal semantic equivalence metrics.
5. Formal methods for detecting ontology mismatch.
6. Self-describing file/protocol formats and bootstrapping under unknown instruction sets.
7. Robust physical-layer/framing inference for interstellar channels.
8. Information-theoretic measures that preserve semantic distinctions rather than only mutual information.
9. Independent receiver architectures for contamination-resistant bootstrap tests.
10. Governance literature for METI and autonomous-contact systems.
11. Formal conditions under which cross-task transfer should be expected from a grounded convention.
12. Methods for constructing adversarial world generators that do not reveal evaluator ontology.
13. Lower bounds on the interaction/strategy set needed to distinguish competing semantic hypotheses.
14. Complexity measures that fairly compare symbolic, denotational, and predictive substrates.
15. Formal criteria for when a proposed semantic-surplus obligation adds claim-specific content rather than arbitrary extra difficulty.
16. Methods for verifying instrumentation/generative provenance without circularly trusting the experiment author.
17. Structured-rival generation methods that reduce evaluator ontology lock-in without making the hypothesis family unfalsifiably open-ended.
18. Boundary-model tests for distributed, overlapping, swarm, and non-agent-like systems.
19. Species-neutral operationalizations of communicative function that do not presuppose human speech-act inventories.
20. Distinguishing false common ground from genuinely shared convention when internal representations are unobservable.
21. Formal tests for pragmatic conservation under asymmetric ontology and modality.
22. Conditions under which absence/withholding can be identified as a causal signal without over-attribution.

## Promotion rule

No `PROJECT_HYPOTHESIS` should be relabeled as supported UNVTRSLR capability without:

- exact experiment/version provenance;
- preregistered acceptance criteria;
- negative controls;
- simpler rivals;
- contamination/leakage audit;
- uncertainty and failure reporting;
- independent reproduction where practical.

For stronger semantic interpretation claims, additionally require where material:

- hypothesis-family provenance;
- claim-discriminating evidence rather than freshness alone;
- structured-alternative stress or an explicitly justified closed family;
- generative/witness provenance sufficient for the claim;
- an evidence-supported claim ceiling;
- a claim-specific falsifiable semantic delta rather than arbitrary extra difficulty.

For stronger pragmatic interpretation claims, apply the same claim-control discipline: preserve lower operational success when the pragmatic label remains unresolved, bind the tested participant/context/function family, and require evidence that distinguishes the claimed pragmatic interpretation from strong live non-pragmatic or alternative-function explanations.
